## All the Lifecycle In A Data Science Projects¶
1.	Data Analysis
2.	Feature Engineering
3.	Feature Selection
4.	Model Building
5.	Model evaluation
### Libraries Included:
Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy.

#### Assumptions of regression
Linearity, Homoscedasticity, multivariate normality, multicollinearity all checked before proceeding for regression.

#### EDA
•	**List comprehension**- Used list comprehension throughout the analysis as they are generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.

•	**Plots used** - Histogram, density plot, boxplot,barplot.

•	**Missing values** -Found missing values in both numerical & categorical features.

•	**Distribution of data** - Data distribution seems skewed, outliers detected with the help of boxplot.

•	**Correlation Matrix** – Found features highly correlated to the target variable.

•	**Categorical variable** – With barplot explored relationship between categorical variable & target variable.
