## All the Lifecycle In A Data Science Projects¶
1.	Data Analysis
2.	Feature Engineering
3.	Feature Selection
4.	Model Building
5.	Model evaluation
### Libraries Included:
Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, scipy.
#### Assumptions of regression
Linearity, Homoscedasticity, multivariate normality, multicollinearity all checked before proceeding for regression.
#### EDA
•	List comprehension- Used list comprehension throughout the analysis as they are generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.

•	Missing values -Found missing values in both numerical & categorical features.

•	Distribution of data- Looking at the numerical distribution data seems skewed, outliers present in the features also saw relation between response variable & predictor variable.

•	Correlation Matrix – Found most correlated features to the target variable.

•	Categorical variable – relationship between categorical variable & target variable.
